A 58-year-old man presented at our hospital with right upper-quadrant pain and fever. He had undergone laparotomic cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy 28 years prior at another hospital. He had been healthy until 3 days before his admission, when his symptoms appeared. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated abscess over the left lobe of the liver and a linear curve of high-density material within a mass (Figure 1; arrow). The patient received antibiotics and underwent aspiration of liver abscess. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed after the symptoms and signs had subsided. ERCP depicted mild dilatation of the CBD and choledojejunostomic fistula of the middle CBD. The patient underwent a biopsy forceps, which removed a 1.7 cm curved, linear, rusty, metallic surgical suture needle containing bile (Figure 2). We examined the patient’s abdominal radiographs, which revealed that the needle was on the right side of the third lumbar spine vertebra (Figure 3; arrow). We followed up with abdominal radiography and detected no further evidence of the needle. The patient was discharged without further events."
ROCOv2_2023_valid_002135,"Abdominal radiographs, which revealed that the needle was on the right side of the third lumbar spine vertebra. The symptoms and signs of a retained surgical item include adhesion, foreign body migration, visceral perforation, and abscess formation [1]. These symptoms can occur early in the postoperative period or may develop after months or years [5]. In prior instances, retained surgical suture needles were surgically removed. However, our patient developed symptoms and signs of a retained needle 28 years after his surgery, by which point the needle had migrated to the ampulla of vater, from where it was easily removed through ERCP. Migrated surgical clips, stents, gauze pieces, suture materials, and fragments of t-tubes have all been reported as retained iatrogenic foreign bodies causing CBD obstruction and subsequent sequelae [2]. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which a retained surgical needle migrated to the ampulla of vater. Needles comprise 0.06–0.11% of foreign bodies that are retained during surgery [7]. Preventing instances of unintentionally retained surgical materials is a critical problem. A nationwide Brazilian study of retained surgical foreign bodies reported that challenging medical situations, security protocol omission, and inadequate work conditions contributed to retained foreign bodies. Sponges are notoriously overlooked because they are routinely inserted into cavities to expose the operative field. Thus, a preventive protocol could involve the introduction of the use of sponge-holding forceps [8]. In conclusion, CBD obstruction caused by foreign bodies can be safely ameliorated through ERCP without complications noted during follow-up."

ROCOv2_2023_valid_002296,"Abdominal computed tomography demonstrating the “whirlpool sign” over the jejunal branches of the superior mesenteric vessels (asterixis) with the feeding jejunostomy tube in place (arrows). In fact, if we conducted POCUS immediately after the physical examination, as an extension of the physical examination, we could obtain the final diagnosis faster without waiting for laboratory tests and symptom relief. This is where the real usefulness of POCUS lies—in speeding up diagnosis and management. Owing to how crowded and busy the emergency department is, many physicians order laboratory studies just after taking patient history and conducting physical examinations without POCUS. If the patient does not have a peritoneal sign and laboratory tests are not abnormal, physicians will screen for abdominal pain. If any of the above changes or abdominal pain persists or worsens, the physicians will arrange an abdominal CT for further confirmation. Abdominal CT has been shown to reduce early return visits [26]. However, if a patient suffers from a vascular emergency such as superior mesenteric artery dissection [27] or abdominal aortic aneurysm [28], “waiting for the laboratory tests” will result in a disaster, due to interventions being delayed. Moreover, abdominal pain is the leading presenting symptom, which accounts for 31% of the symptoms among patients who spend >4 h in the ED [29]. If we perform POCUS immediately after taking the patient’s history and conducting a physical examination, we will obtain the impression earlier, and it will help us to obtain the correct disposition faster. Moreover, it will help to create more order in the emergency department. It may help to relieve overcrowding in the ED and decrease inpatient mortality, the length of stay, and the costs for the admitted patients [30]. However, there is still no direct evidence for this. In the literature, there is only evidence that POCUS could reduce the disposition time in patients with dyspnea [31] and deep vein thrombosis [32]. Feeding jejunostomy is a common surgical procedure for enteral nutrition. However, complications that require re-exploration and that can be life-threatening may develop. Common complications include tube dislocation, abdominal wall or intra-abdominal infection, gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel necrosis, pneumatosis intestinalis [33], fluid and electrolyte imbalances [34], enteral migration [35], and intussusception [36]. Small-bowel volvulus, which refers to the torsion of the alimentary tract, is a rare complication of changing the jejunostomy tube [33,37]. A patient with volvulus may present with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, constipation, nausea, or vomiting. The characteristics of whirlpool signs (mesenteric vessels that have a whirling or spiral shape) can be detected via POCUS [38] or CT. Although abdominal CT is considered the optimal tool for diagnosis [39], POCUS can detect specific and dynamic signs of small-bowel volvulus [38] with no radiation, contrast exposure, lesser expenses, and higher availability. Patients who present with small-bowel volvulus should obtain immediate surgical consultations. If left untreated, it may eventually lead to catastrophic bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation [40]. Our case illustrates that abdominal pain immediately after jejunostomy tube insertion is a sign of life-threatening iatrogenic small-bowel volvulus with a characteristic “whirlpool sign”, which may be detected by POCUS. The pain may be mimicked by benign colic or traction pain caused by the tube. If we performed POCUS as an extension of the physical examination, we would obtain the final diagnosis faster. In addition to the utilization of POCUS in ED patients with abdominal pain, this review identified whether POCUS could reduce the disposition time, length of stay in the ED, and number of return visits for patients with abdominal pain in the ED, as an area for potential policy research and future exploration."

ROCOv2_2023_valid_004442,"FMD is characterized by noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy with no identifiable underlying cause [1]. FMD predominantly involves small to median-sized arteries and affects middle-aged individuals (30 to 50 years old) [2]. According to recent systemic review, cerebrovascular FMD is as common as renal FMD [2]. In contrast to sites susceptible to the atherosclerotic process (proximal internal carotid artery), cerebrovascular FMD commonly involves the middle to distal portion of the internal carotid artery. The most common symptoms of cerebrovascular FMD are pulsatile tinnitus and headache [3]. However, cerebrovascular FMD is frequently asymptomatic and is found by accident through an image examination. Devastating neurologic consequences, such as stroke and transient ischemic attack, can occur in symptomatic patients. Diagnosis of cerebrovascular FMD requires non-invasive and invasive image exams, including CTA, MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Non-invasive CTA and MRA are the modalities of choice whereas DSA remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular FMD. Nevertheless, because of its invasiveness and risk of arterial dissection of the fragile vessels, DSA is commonly reserved for ambiguous cases and those requiring endovascular treatment. The typical imaging findings of cerebrovascular FMD are alternating luminal narrowing and dilatation, resulting in a “string-of-beads” appearance. Fusiform vascular ectasia and vascular loop are also typical features [4]. Other less typical features include aneurysm, arterial dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage [4]. The stroke mechanisms of cerebrovascular FMD are likely heterogeneous, such as cerebral hypoperfusion, cardioembolism, and artery-to-artery embolism [2]. In this case, cerebrovascular FMD resulted in hypoperfusion of the right internal carotid artery, and further caused the right cortical and internal border-zone ischemic infarction. The stroke mechanism is supported by long-segmental severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Subsequent DSA disclosed a classic “string-of-beads” sign in the cervical internal carotid artery (Figure 2). There was no evidence of cardiac emboli or artery-to-artery emboli after 24 h Holter monitoring, echocardiogram, or carotid ultrasound (without atherosclerotic plaque but reduced flow velocity in the right internal carotid artery). The management principles of stroke with cerebrovascular FMD due to arterial stenosis are comparable to stroke without cerebrovascular FMD [5]. During the acute phase of an ischemic stroke, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy are recommended in eligible patients [6]. This patient exceeded the time window for intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy. Thus, an antithrombotic agent with aspirin was prescribed during the acute phase. For the long-term management of secondary stroke prevention, medical therapy should be customized according to stroke mechanisms and co-morbidities for optimal outcomes [7]. Long-term aspirin, antihypertensive agents, statin, and smoking cessation were prescribed for this patient. It is worth mentioning that endovascular therapy, such as carotid stenting or surgical arterial bypass, is typically reserved for patients with recurrent ischemic events despite optimal medical therapy [6,8,9]. At the 18-month follow-up, the patient’s neurologic deficits recover gradually with minimal left hand dexterity impairment. He also manages his chronic diseases well with optimal medication and lifestyle modification (i.e., smoking cessation / increased physical activity). Of particular importance is the relatively young age of the patient, which is the reason for the comprehensive survey of stroke etiologies. In young patients with ischemic stroke, secondary stroke prevention can be properly achieved only when the true stroke etiology is found. To sum up, we demonstrated cerebrovascular FMD as a possible cause of ischemic stroke in young adults. This differential diagnosis should be considered when stroke occurs at a young age with a typical “string-of-beads” sign on CTA, MRA, or DSA. Digital subtraction angiography shows long-segmental alternating luminal narrowing and dilatation of the right internal carotid artery with a typical “string-of-beads” sign (white arrowheads). The diagnosis of cerebrovascular fibromuscular dysplasia is confirmed."

Given the location of the lesion, a WADA test was performed, which demonstrated left brain language dominance. The patient was a professional musician, therefore he wanted to minimize the risk of peri-procedural deficits. As a result of the eloquent location of the lesion, the patient underwent a dose-staged SRS plan over three treatment sessions at 0, 4, and 10 months (C). Dose-staged SRS was felt by the treating physician to minimize risk of deficit. Follow-up imaging demonstrated complete resolution of the AVM two and a half years after initiation of SRS (D,E).

ROCOv2_2023_valid_006035,"Atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), also known as foramen ovale aneurysm, aneurysm of septum primum, and redundant septum primum flap, is usually diagnosed when the foramen ovale flap is hypermobile, extending at least halfway across the left atrium, in a balloon appearance. To measure this hypermobility, the atrial septal excursion index (ASE index) can be calculated as the ratio between the maximum displacement of the atrial septum and the left atrium transverse diameter [1]. The exact prevalence of fetal ASA is not known. Most cases go unreported since this finding is isolated and the evolution uneventful. A more accurate depiction of its prevalence can be extrapolated from newborn series: from 1072 consecutive echocardiograms performed in the early postnatal period, the prevalence of ASA was 7.6% and went up to 11.1% in preterm newborns [2]. Fetal ASA is considered a benign finding, just a transitory phase in the natural history of foramen ovale closure [3,4]. Even though it has a high-resolution rate, ASA should be followed-up prenatally due to its possible complications: fetal cardiac arrhythmias and left ventricle (LV) inflow obstruction. Coarctation of the aorta was also sometimes observed alongside ASA, but there is no known association between these two conditions [1]. ASA-associated arrhythmias consist mostly of premature atrial contractions (PAC), which can sometimes progress to supraventricular tachycardia [5,6,7]. If the foramen ovale flap is very redundant, it can make a cyclical contact with the mitral valve and even protrude in the LV, thus obstructing its inflow. This obstruction can progress to LV hypoplasia and aortic arch hypoplasia [8,9,10]. However, the outcome is usually favorable even in such cases, due to the hemodynamic changes brought about by the first breaths of the newborn. The postnatal normalization of cardiac structures could be explained by the increased pulmonary venous return, which in turn increases the left atrium filling and normalizes the atrial septal position [8], thus correcting the LV preload and output and eventually leading to a normal filling of the aorta. The possibility of changing fetal cardiac physiology was also demonstrated in a small series of ASA cases associated with left heart hypoplasia, where short-term maternal hyperoxygenation induced immediate changes in LV geometry and promoted an anterograde flow through the aortic arch [1]. After birth, ASA is associated with a higher risk of incomplete foramen ovale closure [2], so postnatal echocardiography is formally recommended. Although it is not uncommon to find an ASA in the third trimester, especially with advancing gestation [11], to our knowledge, it has never been reported in the second trimester. We present two cases of ASA diagnosed in the second trimester, and their follow-up in the third trimester. The progression to left heart hypoplasia in one of our cases is a good illustration of how structure fits function—a small LV preload can lead to a decreased LV output, which in turn will end up in a hypoplastic LV and hypoplastic LV outflow tract, but physiological functional changes in the newborn circulation can restore normal cardiac structure. Therefore, during prenatal counseling of suspected LV/aortic arch hypoplasia, one must keep in mind obstructive ASA as a differential diagnosis since the outcome is almost always spontaneously favorable after birth. The first case is of a 33-year-old G4P1, without priors, that presented at 22w3d for her second trimester screening scan. The ultrasound showed a balloon appearance of the foramen ovale flap (ASE index = 0.82), with normal LV inflow. The atrial septal aneurysm was followed up in the third trimester, without notable complications (no PACS, no LV hypoplasia). A healthy baby girl weighing 3750 g was delivered vaginally at 39w. Six months after birth, incomplete closure of the foramen ovale was demonstrated on echocardiography, in the form of a 2 mm interatrial communication.

Hepatic portal venous gas detected by US following liver transplantation or in suppurative cholangitis were described previously [3,4]. Although presence of mesenteric ischemia and gas in the portal venous circulation was previously revealed with computed tomography [5,6], in our case early abdominal US was performed, what expedited definite diagnosis and targeted treatment: choice of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and explorative laparotomy.

ROCOv2_2023_valid_006871,"A chest X-ray was performed at admission, showing scattered nodular opacities in the left lung upper lobe and right lung lower lobe, which indicated a central area of excavation (arrows). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) has increasingly been used to manage cancers and infections [1,2,3]. Since FDG uptake is directly representative of glucose metabolism, it can increase in inflammatory cells as well as tumor cells. Long-term indwelling central venous catheters are necessary for treating cancer patients due to chemotherapy. They depend on their central venous catheters daily, which could predispose a significant risk of complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) [4,5,6]. CRBSI can be complicated by metastatic infectious foci associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate, which should require prolonged systemic antimicrobial treatment [7]. The significant complication of CRBSI is septic thrombosis, with a prevalence of 15~24% [8,9]. The clinical diagnosis of septic foci is critical but may be difficult to establish due to the challenge of determining between sterile catheter-related thrombosis and actual septic thrombosis. Additionally, symptoms are often non-specific, and there is a lack of sensitivity to conventional diagnostic imaging techniques. Only a few studies investigated that 18F-FDG PET/CT can find the infectious foci, demonstrating it as an accurate imaging modality for metastatic foci [10,11,12]. Here, we would like to report a female patient with a Staphylococcus aureus-implantable venous access catheter infection in which 18F-FDG PET/CT determined unsuspected septic pulmonary emboli. A 71-year-old female patient with known ovarian cancer visited our hospital to receive the 4th adjuvant chemotherapy. She was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy and omentectomy 6 months ago. She also had a history of central venous catheterization by the right internal jugular vein approach, terminating at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. The adjuvant chemotherapy was already performed three times as the regimen of Paclitaxel plus Carboplatine after surgery. At admission, she presented no clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea, or chest pain. However, the chest X-ray showed scattered nodular opacities in the left lung upper lobe and right lung lower lobe, suspicious of metastatic nodules (Figure 1). Her blood test showed unexplained leukocytosis (12.58 × 103/μL), elevated D-dimer (9.46 mg/L), and a tumor marker such as CA-125 (41.89 U/mL). 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed 2 days after admission, observing abnormal FDG uptake in the chemo-port catheter, right pectoralis muscle, and 1st costochondral junction (Figure 2a–d). PET/CT also revealed hypermetabolic nodules scattered throughout both lungs, consistent with septic embolism (Figure 2e). In the evening of the day of the PET/CT examination, the patient presented swelling, redness, and some discomfort at the catheter insertion site. The catheter was removed the next day, isolating methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from the catheter tip and peripheral vein. A transthoracic echocardiogram and fundus examination, which were performed to evaluate possible metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis or endophthalmitis, were reported as normal. She was treated with intravenous cefazolin for 4 weeks followed by oral linezolid for 1 week, recovering uneventfully without relapse. She was also treated with rivaroxaban 15 mg for 3 weeks and was diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism. After 2 months, a follow-up chest CT showed that the pre-existing multiple nodules in both lungs had disappeared (Figure 3)."
